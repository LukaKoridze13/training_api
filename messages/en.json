The API is organized by topics, where you can find all requests related to this topic. Please note that the requests marked with a 'lock' symbol require authorization (with a Bearer Token obtained by the user when logging into the system). Also, in the examples of the given objects, all required fields are highlighted in bold. If all fields are in black text, it is optional. The API supports two languages, English (en) and Georgian (ka). To change the language, the Accept-Language header in the request must include the corresponding language code (en, ka)."
